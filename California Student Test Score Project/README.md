# California Student Test Score Project

This project aims to create and model (both linear and quadratic models) various factors that affect California student's test scores using the regsubset() function.

The code automatically regresses using the NVMAX(), and utilizes BIC()[x,] to find the best within that subset. 

This is then clean and processed to CSV and txt for further analysis. 

## To Do:

- [ ] Regress subset and all permutations
      [X] BIC
      [X] R2
      [X] Rbar
      [X] AIC
- [X] FInd best model
      [X] NVMAX = 16
      [X] NMAX = 128
      
- [ ] Plot Graphs

      [ ] QQ Plots
      [ ] Residual and linear fitted model
      [ ] Normality, Leave-one-Out


- [ ] Heteroskedacity

      [ ] JBG Test
      [ ] White Test
      



### Note: This project is on going, and will be periodically updated.
